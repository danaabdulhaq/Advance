The first thing I created was the Observer pattern and its components
  An interface called WeatherDataObserver contains the update function and display
The WeatherDataSubject class contains two variables for temperature and humidity and a list of WeatherDataObserver and a constructor. The RegisterCurrentWeather function was created to add weather data, the NotifyObservers function updates the observer data, and the removeObserver function removes previously recorded data as required to be deleted. The last function is the Get to Return Temperature.
The CurrentConditionsDisplay class and the Interface implementation were created, where I created two variables and the Construct receives a variable of the type WeatherDataSubject class. I implemented the implementation of the Update and Display function via Override, where the Update receives variables and assigns them to the global variables in the class and calls the Display, which displays the weather update.
Finally, the StatisticsDisplay class implemented the WeatherDataObserver and created two variables of type List and Constructor that receives a variable of type WeatherDataSubject and the Update and Display function, where the averages were calculated and called in the Update function.
